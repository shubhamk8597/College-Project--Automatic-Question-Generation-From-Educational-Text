Historical Issues Historical Milestones  From  B.C. first descriptions of length and   weight measures have been found.                                                     In the tower of the Freiburger Mnster a   During the medieval, trade and jurisdiction  stainless metal bar is built in. Its length is  concentrated on the environment around churches.  one Elle  cm, a / of an Elle  First accepted standards have been established  equals one inch.  like the Freiburger Elle.  Each trade center defined individual standards. At the   end of the th century  different definitions of an   Elle and  different definitions of a Pound have   been common.   worldwide valid and accepted standards and    the metric system was established in Paris. But in   some countries it is not used until today e.g. USA.   Since  measurement standards made from platinum   and iridium for the original m and kg are displayed in Paris. . Introduction to Measurement Techniques MKS System   the units Meter, Kilogram and Second were established worldwide for the next   years in Paris, the socalled MKS system. From this system many important units  could be derived.   The Meter was defined as the  millionth fraction of the circumference of earth  orthogonal to the equator.  The Kilogram was defined as the mass of  cubic centimeter cm of water with  maximal density at C.   To complete the MKS system and to improve the accuracy and generality of the units by the help of modern physics,  the SI system Systme International dUnits consisting of   units was founded.   All units can be derived from the basic  SI units.  The definition are mainly based on physical constants.  In principle, these units could be understood by aliens SI System From the  basic SI units for example the following important units can be derived Torque and Energy have identical units Does this mean they are the same Torque throughout this script is named with M, not T as usual in English, because this is the common German abbreviation for Moment. Measurement Techniques are the Foundation of Science  The foundation of science are observations. Science comes up with theories that aim to  explain existing observations and predict future ones. If theory and observations   contradict each other, either the observations are flawed or the theory is wrong  falsification. The more independent observations support a theory, the more likely it  is true. But, in principle, it can never be proven verification  Very concrete and quantitative observations are measurements. Mainly with their help  sciences progresses, in particular natural sciences.  Discovered patterns within the measurements often lead towards a theory that is  coherent with them.  New technological possibilities often have supported or refuted theories. Example   The measured spectrum of black body radiation was in contradiction to the classical theory.  The introduction of quantization of the emitted frequencies by Planck in  could   align theory and observations. This was the birth of quantum mechanics which ironically  Planck never accepted.  Example Interferometer Experiment by MichelsonMorley  The experiment by Michelson in  and a refined version by  Morley in  tried to prove that some stuff in vacuum exist  German ther that transmits light waves. The theory at this  time stated that any wave needs a medium for its transportation  in order to propagate the energy. Examples are water waves or  sounds with air as the medium. That vacuum is simply empty was  unimaginable because light can travel through space. So what is  the medium that light needs This obscure stuff was not found and called ther. The inter ferometer experiment was designed to find out whether it exists. If the earth travels through ther then turning the interferometer  changes the speed direction and should lead to a phase shift because light should be faster or slower depending on the relative ther  speed. But nothing happened Light speed always is c in vacuum.  No ther exists. This was explained by Einsteins theory of  special relativity in .   Measurement for Feedback Control Control is based on measuring the quantity that shall be controlled. Without the measurement there is no feedback possible, no comparison between desired and actual value. In many applications in signal processing a delay is not very tragic. If you see a football goal   ms delayed because of computations in your digital TV this is no significant drawback.  This is different in feedback control The controlled variable must be fed back to the  comparison of desired with actual value immediately. Any delay due to a slow sensor  or filtering or other signal processing techniques deteriorates the control performance. You can never make up for a delay in a subsequent step  Measuring Definition Measuring means comparing with an agreed unit.  A measurement consists of a number and a unit. The number describes which multiple of the unit is assigned    measurement  number  unit  Examples    Speed   m/s   ms,    Mass   kg,    Force   kgm/s   N Requirements . The quantity to be measured must be qualitatively uniquely determined.  . The standard unit must be defined by a convention.  These requirements are not met by many quantities in our everyday lives, like  wellness, beauty, intelligence. Measurement Setup A measurement setup typically consists of  blocks  .  The quantity to be measured by a sensor is converted into an electrical signal. Recently  the term smart sensor has become popular. This means sensors that incorporate an  intelligent signal processing that carries out tasks inside the sensor like filtering, data  reduction, extraction of features, combining different physical principles,   .  The electrical signal is converted into another electrical signal which is e.g. of   higher power and/or digital, etc.  .  The amplified and possibly digitized signal is outputted to a display, printer, plotter or  only saved.  converter,  Process Sensor amplifier, ...  output device Measurement Method   Deflection Method The measured quantity is directly converted into the output, e.g. a  display. No support energy is needed from outside. The required energy for the  conversion is taken from the medium or the environment e.g. gravitation.   Examples spring balance, expansion thermometer.  Difference Method The measured quantity is compared with a quantity from outside.  This quantity for comparison stays constant during the measurement. The difference  between both is the output. Example volume measurement displaced liquid.  Compensation Method A quantity opposed to the measured quantity is applied. A zero   indicator determines whether both quantities are equal. If so the compensation quantity is  a measure for the original one. The compensation quantity   can be of other kind than the original one.   Examples Equalarmed balance with weights as   compensation quantity same kind   or with an electromagnet induced force different kind http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileBalancescaleIMGP.jpg Measuring Technique   Direct Measurement Comparison with a gauge. The most fundamental technique.  Example Length measurement with a ruler.   Indirect Measurement The quantity to be measured is determined by other relevant  quantities. Examples Determination of pressure by measuring force and dividing by the  area. Determination of power by measuring voltage and current and multiplying them.  Determination of speed by measuring distance and time and dividing them.  Determination of acceleration by measuring speed and differentiating.    Incremental Measurement From a reference point, increments  smallest change are  added or subtracted to determine the actual value. Typically, equidistant markings are   scanned optically or magnetically or otherwise. Examples Measuring angles or  displacements.  Analog and Digital Measurement Processing . Literature . J.

Measurement Methods and Amplifier Circuits  Why is the measurement of electrical quantities so important Electrical current possesses many advantages over alternative physical means to transport energy and information like with air pressure or hydraulics. Electricity is  Easy to measure with high efficiency.  Easy and with high efficiency to transform to other quantities with motors torque,  speed, electric heating heat or air conditioning coldness, lamp or LED light.   Well and easy to control.   Efficiently to transport over long distances.   Almost everywhere available.  Standard means to transmit information.   Easy to covert into digital signals and to process in a computer. Because of these advantages electricity plays a dominant role in measuring things sensorics and manipulating things actuation. At least the last part in sensorics and the first part in actuators is often of electrical nature to exploit the good controllability properties.  First Principles A magnetic field of flux density B generates a force  on a wire of length l that is orthogonal to the field  and carries an electrical current I. The generated Lorentz force is calculated by  This force is proportional to the current and can be used to indicate  its value. If this force is in balance with a spring, a pointer can  display the size of the current.  More accurately, the force is generated in N windings of a coil.  Because it acts on each side of the coil, the actual torque is twice this force times the distance r diameter of the coil  d  r.  This gives the torque Acting on a torsion spring with torque M  c  results in a displayed angle .

Measurement of Current Some Facts on the Moving Coil Mechanism Meter  Most frequently applied analog way to measure currents.   Range A  A. Accuracy ,  ,. Settling Time  ,s  s.   With resistors in parallel the range can be changed.  By coupling it with an DC converter it can be used to measure an AC current.  With an auxiliary resistor and Ohms law, it can be used to measure voltage.   Replacing the permanent magnet creating B by an electromagnet, the meter can be used  for measurement of power. Change of Range  . Measurement of Current Systematic Error of Current Measurement   Circuit without meter      Circuit with meter  measured too   small   Current meters should have an internal resistance as small as possible Using a Current Meter for Measuring a Voltage   Circuit without meter   Circuit with meter  II U   True voltage    This leads to a relative error in the voltage measurement of  Voltage is  measured too   small     Voltage meters should have an internal resistance as large as possible  Change of Range Internal Resistance  RM Internal Resistance RM Internal Resistance RM  Nomenclature of Voltage Meters The internal resistance is given in relation to the upper range value and in /V.  E.g.  k/V means    k internal resistance within the range  V.    k internal resistance within the range  V, etc.  Considerations About the Systematic Errors in Current and Voltage Measurements  To reduce the deterioration in current measurements, we want to have a small internal  resistance, in the ideal case RM  .   To reduce the deterioration in voltage measurements, we want to have a large internal  resistance, in the ideal case RM  .   The demand for a small internal resistance is much more difficult to fulfill than the  demand for a large internal resistance, because   the coil of the moving coil mechanism naturally has a finite resistance, in particular if  N is high,    also the connections/contacts where the meter is attached have a resistance,    amplifier circuits easily can generate a resistance close to RM   see Chapter ..  These arguments show that a voltage measurement can be performed more accurately than a current measurement.  Therefore we can apply a trick to use voltage measurements for determining currents.  Indirect Current Measurement With a Shunt A Shunt is a measurement resistor that has been manufactured with care expensive to ensure a low resistance with great accuracy almost independent of disturbing influences like temperature. The voltage drop over such a shunt is measured and by Ohms law the flowing current is determined. Compared to a direct current measurement, which incorporates the meter in series within the circuit, the following advantages are obtained  The resistance of shunt is more accurate than the internal  Direct current measurement  resistance of the meter.    Smaller measurement error.   The resistance of the shunt can be chosen to be smaller than   the internal resistance of the meter.    Smaller measurement error. Indirect current measurement via a shunt  The wires and connections to the meter lead to a voltage drop   and are sources of measurement errors. Because the current   through the voltage meter is tiny  I, these are insignificant  compared to the direct method.   . Measurement of Power and Energy First Principles Electrical power is the product between voltage and current Replacing the permanent magnet of the moving coil mechanism creating the magnetic field B by an electromagnet, constructs the electrodynamic instrument. It can measure power. If the electromagnet is fed with voltage U this creates a current and subsequently a magnetic field proportional to U With the formula for the moving coil mechanism we obtain  The generated torque is proportional to the power P.   .
